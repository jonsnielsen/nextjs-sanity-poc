* use lingui
* have some empty .po files
* at build time get all translations and asynchrounously create keys and add translations for each locale.
  If a locale doesn't have anything in their own language, use default english.  
  If a locale doesn't have a specific english translation, use default english.
  
Other approach
* Simply have each page every translation (for that locale) as a prop. Then there is no file thing.
* If a locale doesn't have anything in their own language, use default english.  
* If a locale doesn't have a specific english translation, use default english.
* Guess there won't be a flicker when changing pages client side, as long as we use a 'language' hook.
  That is because when changing language client side, the serverside rendered version is not used.
  
Each page should only have the translations of that specific region.


 // DEAR JONATHAN. NEXT STEP IS TO ADD defaultState in `getStaticProps` in `_app.js` so redux can use the langugage id in initial state.
